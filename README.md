# zoomprefs

A small (VERY WIP & hacked together) script for storing your Zoom preferences on enterprise machines. This is probably not necessary but I'm sharing here for anyone who may find it useful :)

## What It Does

* Backs up a copy of your Zoom App's preferences
* Runs in the background, only watching the Zoom App's version
* When the version of the Zoom App changes, it should restore the saved preferences
* Profit? Do a nerdy dance? Contact our IT folks for a more robust solution? These are all solid options, dear reader. The choice is yours!

## Usage

Run the included [ZoomBackupRestore](ZoomBackupRestore.app) as a background app that starts with your Mac. It may help to give it permissions to manage your Applications; I'll add more info on that here once I confirm that's all it needs.

## Feedback

Help me improve this script by opening an issue or PR!
